# 🔄 LinkedIn Job Toggle Feature – Enhancing User Experience for Job Seekers & Content Consumers  

## 📖 Overview  
The **LinkedIn Job Toggle Feature** introduces a **seamless way for users to personalize their LinkedIn experience**, allowing them to switch between **two primary modes**:

- **🟠 Breakout Mode:** A space optimized for content engagement, where users can interact with industry discussions, creator-driven posts, and thought leadership articles.  

This feature ensures **job seekers stay focused** while **content consumers engage more deeply**, reducing distractions and improving overall LinkedIn engagement.
